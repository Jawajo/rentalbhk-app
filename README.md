# RentalBHK - AI-Powered Property Rental Platform

RentalBHK is a modern, AI-powered property rental platform built with Next.js, Firebase, and Google's Genkit. It provides a seamless and secure experience for tenants to find properties and for owners to list and manage them.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Search**: Tenants can use natural language queries (e.g., "Find a 2BHK in Chennai under 25k") to discover properties.
- **AI-Assisted Verification**: Property listings are analyzed by an AI flow that compares submitted details with document information to provide a verification score, enhancing trust.
- **Secure Online Rentals**: A complete online flow for the first month's rent, including owner OTP confirmation, secure payments, and an official rental certificate.
- **Admin & Super Admin Dashboards**: Comprehensive dashboards to manage pending verifications, users, platform revenue, and financial settings.
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login for tenants, owners, and admins using Firebase Authentication.
- **Multi-Step Property Listing**: An intuitive, multi-step form for property owners to list their properties, including document uploads and live location detection.
- **Secure Chat**: A built-in, private communication channel between tenants and property owners.
